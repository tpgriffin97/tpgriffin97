- 👋 Hi, my name is Tristan Griffin! I'm a first generation graduate from the University of Tennessee looking to break into computer science. At a young age I used to go to work with my mother when she couldn't have someone watch me. Eventually, she set me up with a spare computer in a backroom and I became fascinated ever since. While I did at one point purse a degree in computer science, I found it wasn't for me at the time. I was saddled with a lot of personal issues and responsiblities that impeded me. I still finished a degree in Psychology due to a deep desire to understand people and their behaviors - as well as a never-ending respect for therapists. 

- 👀 At this time I am currently seeking entry-level positions at any company willing to recruit a hardworker. I remain dedicated to self-driven educationa and personal growth, even coding before work, during my breaks, and after work. When you work with me you work with someone trying to make a difference

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, and various modules and frameworks. Currently, as of September 2022, I learning to create data entry to visualization pipelines. My aim is to utilize Python as the backbone,sqlite3 as the database manager, tkinter as the frontend, and matplotlib to visualize database information. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginnger - intermediate level projects, but at this time I'm working fully independent 99% of the time. I meet with software engineers in the field to network and learn and grow as a developer.
